# Predicting Football Outcomes with Linear Regression

This project explores the relationship between match statistics and European football team success using linear regression. The model identifies key predictors of outcomes such as goals scored, goal difference, and match results.

## Overview

- **Goal**: Build a regression model to predict football match performance based on in-game statistics.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Excel
- **Dataset**: [Football Correlation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michael1466/football-correlation-4-2-25) (Kaggle)

## Key Features

- Cleaned and visualized football match data
- Explored correlations between stats like possession, shots on target, and outcomes
- Applied multiple linear regression to predict team performance metrics
- Interpreted R² scores, p-values, and residual plots to assess model fit

## Sample Output

> *"Goal difference and shots on target were the strongest predictors of success. The final model achieved an R² of 0.72."*
